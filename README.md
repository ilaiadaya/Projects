# Ilai Bachrach

My work follows a simple formula: data + story = powerful messages. 
I explore psychology, art, education, teaching and social networks... through DATA SCIENCE.
I'm dedicated to shaping a better tomorrow. I have boundless curiosity to learn more and improve how I learn, collaborate with brilliant people and to always stay humble.
