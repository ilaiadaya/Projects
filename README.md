# Ilai's latest work

Update: Some of my latest work is not available on github due to NDA agreements with CVMaker and Machine Learning Programs (MLP).

My work follows a simple formula: data + story = powerful messages. 
In it I explore topics like psychology, art, education, teaching and social networks... through DATA SCIENCE.

### A little about myself

I'm dedicated to shaping a better tomorrow. I have boundless curiosity to: learn more and improve how I learn, collaborate with brilliant people, and to always stay humble.
