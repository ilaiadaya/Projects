# Ilai's latest work

My latest work follows a simple formula: data + story = powerful messages. 
In it I explore topics like psychology, art, education, teaching and social networks... through DATA SCIENCE.

### A little about myself

I'm dedicated to shaping a better tomorrow. I have boundless curiosity to: learn more and improve how I learn, collaborate with brilliant people, and to always stay humble.
