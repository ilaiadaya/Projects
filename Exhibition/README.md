#  Art Exhibition 2019 "Question Reality"

## Artwork 1

The introduction of technology like augmented reality has enabled new means to communicate messages. Look at the Animation and see what it does to you.
This piece makes use of AR to tell the story of the Israel Palestine Conflict, and how questioning one’s own victim-status, helps create a sense of empathy and awareness of perspective.  Ask yourself if you are the only person who considers themselve the victim.

## Artwork 2

Look at the photograph. Now look at the video, and see what it does to your perception of the piece. See how the mountain represents the income inequality graph.

This piece tells the story of transcending boundaries and opportunities between children in Tanzania and in our world. It also sheds light on the seeming differences between “them” and “us” through the peculiar and divergent use of colours. 

Photography from Tanzania.

## Artwork 3

Look at the computer of the boy, and the one in front of you. In the last decades, there has been a transformation in how children play. The shift from physical to the digital has been caused by technological advancements.
This piece tells the story of children who used to play with lego, are now sitting in front of their laptop, playing age-inappropriate video games or watching tv shows. The artwork seems as pixelated as the digital world that is consuming todays children.

Politics are often subject to a divide between two sides, a left or right. Observing the piece from the center, we see reality. It’s skewed, unfiltered, complex, a state we don’t want to be in. Try seeing how staying in this state of distortion and uncertainty affects you.
This is the story of observing art from either the left/right side. Doing so reveals Trump in distress as a distorted Lego Figure or “TheRealDonaldTrump”, coincidentally Trump’s twitter name.

## Artwork 5

The LED illuminates the irony that a two dimensional view of the world can be presented in three dimensions. The old man and the boy could be you.
This piece tells the story of imagining a two dimensional world where you can only see lines defining reality. Three dimensionality is broken up into simple frames, a lifetime compressed into one moment. By stripping away dimensions in our life, we unify perceived boundaries and remove “made up perspectives”.

## Artwork 6

Move around the piece. See how individual tiles can connect to form part of the landscape.

This piece tells the story of transcending actual and perceived boundaries. Not only does it ask people to question reality by seeing physical perspectives of one landscape, it also
gives people the opportunity to
question their own psychology in light of a “bigger picture”, that unifies perspectives of people. 

## Artwork 7

Look and move around. 

Capturing movement in a still image is not possible.  But wait…, maybe it is, because your eyes are moving around. 
See what this realization does to you. This piece tells the story of showing how something that is not possible from one perspective, is possible from another.

## Artwork 8

Look and move around. 

This piece tells the story of how we can never see everything and know everything. We must learn to look at different perspectives and to look further than what we initially see. 

The metal chains which carry the sculpture, reflect the image of the “shackles limiting our vision” which are to be broken up (Dali).
